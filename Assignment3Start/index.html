          <h3>Infernal Witch Designs</h3>
          <p>Infernal Witch Designs is my small business that I have currently been working on. Right now I am in the middle of rebranding it to Wisteria Witch Designs and working on creating more products to sell. I am also creating social media accounts for the business, as well as creating a social media schedule in order to try to reach a wider audience.</p>

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>I have always loved photography and taking pictures. Over the past couple of years, I have been doing my best to learn as much as I can about photography and I take any opportunities to use my skills. One such opportunity was being able to take a beautiful couple's engagement photographs for them. I have also done photoshoots for: headshots, portraits and parties before.</p>
